        <p><b><i>prox.Dance</i></b> revolves around proximity and distance. We explore the distance between our two bodies by
          increasing and decreasing the space between each other. We are interested in how technology can advance our understanding
          of the body as a source of sound. So, from there we look at the ways in which we could develop our own bodies as instruments
          by using IR sensors that detects movement in a specific range of distance.</p>

        <p>This performance thinks about the importance of sound in our everyday life, but also the importance of sound in our
          environment, in our own bodies, the way sounds allow us to share, be social and learn. One of the thing th­­­at interests us
          in working with inaudible sounds is that by amplifying them, you can make audible and visible a whole other world that we
          are part of, that our bodies constitute.</p>

        <p>We modulate FM synthesis algorithms to have a great variation in terms of sound. We have 5 of them and are dividing
          the performance in 5 scenes. We explore the range of variations available through these algorithms by modulating the distance between us.</p>

        <p>We use sensors, convert their analog signals into digital MIDI data and modify FM synthesis main parameters
          like frequency, harmonicity and modulation index. The visual is taken from a webcam, located close from us in
          order to keep track of every sensible movement. We project the output of the camera on our bodies and as we
          get closer and further, the contrast of the video increases. </p>
