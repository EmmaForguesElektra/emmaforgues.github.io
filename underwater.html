        <p><b><i>UnderWater</i></b>, video installation, 2015 04:55</p>
        <p>UnderWater is a projection interacting
        with a drawing. I experimented with the
        expressive design language by establishing a link between
        a still image and a projected moving image. During the video,
        there are more sequences of the body which floats in the water
        that correspond to a drawing which represents 6 trajectories
        of the subjectâ€™s body. For me, water is the dream, a passage,
        even a meditative connection. I like the idea that water can
        be both a vital and a destructive element.</p>
