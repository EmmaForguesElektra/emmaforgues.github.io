        <p>When we seek to go from one place to another, we usually prefer to find the most efficient way of arriving to destination. It matches the values of our current days, leaning towards utility and speed.</p>
        <p>Google Maps is a relevant example of that, as many people rely on it to figure out their commuting. It makes our paths very predictable and susceptible to numerous advertisements. Corporations take advantage of the common paths in metropolises to further citizens’ consumerist habits. Since we are excluded from the design of our visual environment in those spaces, we lack involvement in the information we absorb and in decision-making about our own lives.</p>
        <p>ALT.PATH offers an alternative to the way we come to think about the world we perceive; it moves away from efficiency and towards creativity, agency and curiosity. The core of the application embraces the say “All roads lead to Rome,” since it considers that there are many ways to arrive to the destination and that no option is a loss of time.</p>
        <p>ALT.PATH’s creators encourage the user to derive from the shortest path and explore a neighbourhood they thought they knew, get out of their comfort zone and fall back in love with the beauties of life.</p>
