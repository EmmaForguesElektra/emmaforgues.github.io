        <p><b><i>Image Contamination</i></b>, mutli-screen projection, 2015 03:32</p>
        <!-- <p>This is a multi-screen projection. I decided to film
        several shots of the same person: her eyes, her mouth,
        the right and left sides of her face. I filmed the subject
        profile and made some wide shots, medium shots, etc.
        I filmed in the forest one night, using only a headlamp
        as lighting in order to create a certain aesthetic of
        the video derived from an uncomfortable situation.
        During video editing, I was inspired by the work of the artist
        Tony Oursler to make the composition.</p> -->
